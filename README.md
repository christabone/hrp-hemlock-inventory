# Hemlock Ravine Park Hemlock Inventory Project
## Overview
This repository hosts the data and findings of an [Eastern Hemlock tree survey](https://tabone.dev/hrp-hemlock-inventory) conducted at Hemlock Ravine Park in Halifax, Nova Scotia. 

This volunteer project aims to catalog Hemlock trees in the park, focusing on their size and distribution.

## Project Details
- Scope of Survey: Cataloging every Hemlock tree near hiking trails with a diameter of approximately 30cm or greater (measured at breast height, 1.3 meters from the ground).
- Location Focus: Initially concentrating on areas close to the trails, with plans to expand to more remote parts of the park.
- Data Filtering: The website features a sliding filter for selecting trees based on diameter range.
- GPS Accuracy: Location data gathered using an external GPS with an accuracy of +/- 2 meters.
- Health Monitoring: Each tree has been inspected for signs of Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (HWA) infestation. Results are marked as 'Yes', 'No', or 'NA' (not accessible).
- Data Accessibility: Alongside the visual representation on the website, a comprehensive spreadsheet will be made available soon.

## Software and Tools
- GPS Device: Columbus P-7 Pro
- All survey data was collected, processed, and visualized using [QGIS 3.32.3-Lima](https://qgis.org/en/site/) and [QFieldCloud](https://qfield.cloud/).
- Data was exported to web-compatible format via the [qgis2web](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/qgis2web/) plugin.
