# Hemlock Ravine Park Hemlock Inventory Project
## Overview
This repository hosts the data and findings of an Eastern Hemlock tree survey conducted at Hemlock Ravine Park in Halifax, Nova Scotia. 

This volunteer project aims to catalog Hemlock trees in the park, focusing on their size and distribution.

## Project Details
- Scope of Survey: Cataloging every Hemlock tree near hiking trails with a diameter of approximately 30cm or greater (measured at breast height, 1.3 meters from the ground).
- Location Focus: Initially concentrating on areas close to the trails, with plans to expand to more remote parts of the park.
- Data Filtering: The website features a sliding filter for selecting trees based on diameter range.
- GPS Accuracy: Location data gathered using an external GPS with an accuracy of +/- 2 meters.
- Health Monitoring: Each tree has been inspected for signs of Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (HWA) infestation. Results are marked as 'Yes', 'No', or 'NA' (not accessible).
- Data Accessibility: Alongside the visual representation on the website, a comprehensive spreadsheet will be made available soon.
